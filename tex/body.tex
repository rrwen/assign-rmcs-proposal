\section{Literature Review} \label{literature-review}

This section provides a literature review to provide background knowledge on current research related to the topic of \textit{"real-time geosocial media event detection and prediction"}. The paper selection process involved identifying reputable digital libraries using the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) measure \cite{Garfield:2006b}, followed by using automatic search queries provided by the identified digital libraries to produce an initial list of potential papers. The potential papers from the automatic search queries were then further filtered by manual selection criteria to produce a list of selected papers for reviewing. Appendix \ref{appendix:literature-review-methods} details the digital libraries, automatic search queries, manual selection criteria, and procedure used for selecting and reviewing papers.
